Install plugins as submodulesWith pathogen installed, itâ€™s now possible to keep the files for 
each plugin together, which means that every plugin can be kept in its own git repository. 
The best way to do this is to use git submodules, which are designed especially for the purpose 
of keeping git repositories within a git repository.To install the fugitive plugin as a git submodule, 
take the following steps:
cd ~/.vim
mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
git submodule add http://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git bundle/fugitive
git add .
git commit -m "Install Fugitive.vim bundle as a submodule."

Instead, we're here using a generic addons folder since we want to add on to tmux and bash and other 
places as well and track it and store the config and make it portable across machines !
